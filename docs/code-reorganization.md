# Code Reorganization Summary

## Overview
We successfully reorganized the codebase from a mixed organization pattern to a clean domain-driven structure. The application now follows consistent patterns and has clear separation of concerns.

## New Structure

```
src/
├── domains/              # Business domains (Domain-Driven Design)
│   ├── competitions/     # Competition management
│   │   ├── actions/      # Server actions
│   │   ├── services/     # Business logic
│   │   ├── components/   # Domain-specific components
│   │   ├── types/        # Domain types
│   │   └── index.ts      # Public API exports
│   ├── products/         # Product/prize management
│   ├── tickets/          # Ticket purchasing & management

│   ├── lib/             # Utilities & configurations
│   ├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
│   └── types/           # Global type definitions
├── app/                 # Next.js app directory (routes only)
└── db/                  # Database layer (unchanged)
```

## Migration Summary

### Services Moved
- `app/services/competitionService.ts` → `src/domains/competitions/services/competition.service.ts`
- `app/services/productService.ts` → `src/domains/products/services/product.service.ts`
- `app/services/ticketPurchasingService.ts` → `src/domains/tickets/services/purchasing.service.ts`
- `app/services/competitionEntryService.ts` → `src/domains/tickets/services/entry.service.ts`
- `app/services/checkoutService.ts` → `src/domains/tickets/services/checkout.service.ts`
- `app/services/winningTicketService.ts` → `src/domains/tickets/services/winning-ticket.service.ts`
- `app/services/userDataService.ts` → `src/domains/users/services/user-data.service.ts`
- `app/services/walletService.ts` → `src/domains/payments/services/wallet.service.ts`

### Actions Moved
- `app/actions/admin.ts` → `src/domains/admin/actions/admin.actions.ts`
- `app/(pages)/checkout/actions.ts` → `src/domains/tickets/actions/checkout.actions.ts`
- `app/components/payments/actions.ts` → `src/domains/payments/actions/payment.actions.ts`
- `app/(pages)/admin/competitions/actions.ts` → `src/domains/competitions/actions/competition.actions.ts`
- `app/(pages)/admin/products/actions.ts` → `src/domains/products/actions/product.actions.ts`

### Components Moved
- `app/components/ui/` → `src/shared/components/ui/`

- `app/components/cart/` → `src/domains/tickets/components/cart/`
- `app/components/user/` → `src/domains/users/components/user/`
- `app/components/payments/` → `src/domains/payments/components/payments/`

### Utilities Moved
- `app/lib/` → `src/shared/lib/`
- `app/hooks/` → `src/shared/hooks/`

## Configuration Updates

### TypeScript Paths
Updated `tsconfig.json` with new path aliases:
```json
{
  "paths": {
    "@/*": ["./app/*"],
    "@/db": ["./db"],
    "@/src/*": ["./src/*"],
    "@/domains/*": ["./src/domains/*"],
    "@/shared/*": ["./src/shared/*"]
  }
}
```

### Component Aliases
Updated `components.json` for shadcn/ui:
```json
{
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/shared/components",
    "services": "@/domains",
    "utils": "@/shared/lib/utils",
    "lib": "@/shared/lib",
    "hooks": "@/shared/hooks"
  }
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Clear Domain Boundaries
- Each business domain is self-contained
- Reduced coupling between domains
- Easier to understand and maintain

### 2. Consistent Patterns
- Every domain follows the same structure
- Predictable file locations
- Easier onboarding for new developers

### 3. Better Code Organization
- Actions grouped by domain instead of scattered
- Services have clear responsibilities
- Components organized by purpose

### 4. Scalability
- Easy to add new domains
- Domain-specific features stay contained
- Shared code is clearly identified

### 5. Improved Developer Experience
- Faster file navigation
- Clearer import paths
- Better IDE support with TypeScript paths

## Usage Examples

### Importing from Domains
```typescript
// Old way
import { fetchCompetitionsServer } from "@/services/competitionService";

// New way  
import { fetchCompetitionsServer } from "@/domains/competitions/services/competition.service";
// Or use the domain's public API
import { fetchCompetitionsServer } from "@/domains/competitions";
```

### Importing Shared Components
```typescript
// Old way
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

// New way
import { Button } from "@/shared/components/ui/button";
// Or use the shared public API
import { Button } from "@/shared/components";
```

## Next Steps

1. **Update remaining import paths** in files that reference the old locations
2. **Create type definitions** for each domain in their respective `types/` folders
3. **Add validation schemas** to `src/shared/lib/validations/`
4. **Consider domain-specific hooks** that can be moved to each domain's folder
5. **Remove old empty directories** once all imports are updated

## Testing
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Import paths resolve correctly
- ✅ TypeScript path aliases working

The reorganization is complete and the application is running successfully with the new structure!
