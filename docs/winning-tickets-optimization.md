# Winning Tickets Optimization: From Arrays to Tables

## Overview

This document explains the optimization from array-based winning ticket management to a dedicated table-based approach, providing better performance, data integrity, and scalability.

## Problems with Array-Based Approach

### 1. Performance Issues
```sql
-- OLD: Array containment checks (slow)
SELECT * FROM competition_prizes 
WHERE winning_ticket_numbers @> '[123]';

-- OLD: Array mutations (expensive)
UPDATE competition_prizes 
SET winning_ticket_numbers = array_remove(winning_ticket_numbers, 123),
    claimed_winning_tickets = array_append(claimed_winning_tickets, 123);
```

### 2. Concurrency Problems
- Multiple users claiming the same ticket simultaneously
- Race conditions in array mutations
- Complex transaction handling

### 3. Data Integrity Issues
- Duplicate ticket numbers across arrays
- No foreign key constraints to users
- No audit trail for claims

### 4. Scalability Limitations
- Large arrays become slow to query
- Array operations don't scale well
- Memory overhead for large competitions

## New Table-Based Approach

### 1. Dedicated `winning_tickets` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE winning_tickets (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  competition_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES competitions(id),
  prize_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES competition_prizes(id),
  ticket_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'available',
  claimed_by_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  claimed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. Proper Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- Efficient lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_winning_tickets_competition_id ON winning_tickets(competition_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_winning_tickets_ticket_number ON winning_tickets(ticket_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_winning_tickets_status ON winning_tickets(status);

-- Unique constraint prevents duplicates
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_winning_tickets_unique_ticket 
ON winning_tickets(competition_id, ticket_number);
```

## Performance Comparison

### Checking if a Ticket is a Winner

#### OLD Approach (Array-based)
```typescript
// Multiple array scans required
const prizes = await db
  .selectFrom("competition_prizes")
  .select(["id", "winning_ticket_numbers", "claimed_winning_tickets"])
  .where("competition_id", "=", competitionId)
  .execute();

let isWinning = false;
let isAvailable = false;
for (const prize of prizes) {
  if (prize.winning_ticket_numbers?.includes(ticketNumber)) {
    isWinning = true;
    isAvailable = !prize.claimed_winning_tickets?.includes(ticketNumber);
    break;
  }
}
```

#### NEW Approach (Table-based)
```typescript
// Single indexed lookup
const ticket = await db
  .selectFrom("winning_tickets")
  .select(["status", "prize_id"])
  .where("competition_id", "=", competitionId)
  .where("ticket_number", "=", ticketNumber)
  .executeTakeFirst();

const isWinning = !!ticket;
const isAvailable = ticket?.status === "available";
```

**Performance Gain**: ~10-100x faster for large competitions

### Claiming a Winning Ticket

#### OLD Approach (Array-based)
```typescript
// Complex array manipulation with race conditions
const prize = await db
  .selectFrom("competition_prizes")
  .select(["id", "winning_ticket_numbers", "claimed_winning_tickets"])
  .where("winning_ticket_numbers", "@>", [ticketNumber])
  .executeTakeFirst();

const updatedWinningTickets = prize.winning_ticket_numbers?.filter(
  (num) => num !== ticketNumber
);
const updatedClaimedTickets = [
  ...(prize.claimed_winning_tickets || []),
  ticketNumber,
];

await db
  .updateTable("competition_prizes")
  .set({
    winning_ticket_numbers: updatedWinningTickets,
    claimed_winning_tickets: updatedClaimedTickets,
  })
  .where("id", "=", prize.id)
  .execute();
```

#### NEW Approach (Table-based)
```typescript
// Atomic update with built-in race condition protection
const claimedTicket = await db
  .updateTable("winning_tickets")
  .set({
    status: "claimed",
    claimed_by_user_id: userId,
    claimed_at: new Date(),
  })
  .where("competition_id", "=", competitionId)
  .where("ticket_number", "=", ticketNumber)
  .where("status", "=", "available") // Prevents double-claiming
  .returning("id")
  .executeTakeFirst();
```

**Benefits**:
- Atomic operation prevents race conditions
- No complex array manipulations
- Built-in concurrency protection
- Proper audit trail

## Query Performance Improvements

### Statistics and Reporting

#### OLD Approach
```typescript
// Multiple queries and array processing
const prizes = await db
  .selectFrom("competition_prizes")
  .select(["winning_ticket_numbers", "claimed_winning_tickets"])
  .where("competition_id", "=", competitionId)
  .execute();

let totalWinning = 0;
let totalClaimed = 0;
for (const prize of prizes) {
  totalWinning += prize.winning_ticket_numbers?.length || 0;
  totalClaimed += prize.claimed_winning_tickets?.length || 0;
}
```

#### NEW Approach
```typescript
// Single aggregation query
const stats = await db
  .selectFrom("winning_tickets")
  .select([
    "status",
    db.fn.count("id").as("count"),
  ])
  .where("competition_id", "=", competitionId)
  .groupBy("status")
  .execute();
```

**Performance Gain**: ~5-20x faster for statistics queries

### User's Winning History

#### OLD Approach
```typescript
// Complex queries across multiple tables with array processing
// Would require joining and filtering arrays - very inefficient
```

#### NEW Approach
```typescript
// Simple indexed query
const userWinnings = await db
  .selectFrom("winning_tickets as wt")
  .innerJoin("competition_prizes as cp", "cp.id", "wt.prize_id")
  .innerJoin("products as p", "p.id", "cp.product_id")
  .select([
    "wt.ticket_number",
    "wt.claimed_at",
    "p.name as prize_name",
    "p.market_value",
  ])
  .where("wt.claimed_by_user_id", "=", userId)
  .orderBy("wt.claimed_at", "desc")
  .execute();
```

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Create New Table
```sql
-- Migration 016: Create winning_tickets table
-- Migrates existing array data to new table structure
```

### 2. Dual-Write Period
- Write to both systems during transition
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Gradual service migration

### 3. Verification Phase
- Compare results between systems
- Run parallel queries to ensure correctness
- Monitor performance improvements

### 4. Complete Migration
- Remove array-based code
- Drop unused columns (optional)
- Full optimization
