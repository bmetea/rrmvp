# Competition Ticket and Prize Distribution Logic

## Overview
This document outlines the logic for managing competition tickets and prize distribution across three phases.

## Competition Structure

### Core Properties
- **competition_total_tickets**: Total number of tickets available for the competition
- **competition_phase_number**: Number of phases (always 3)
- **phase_total_winning_tickets**: Total winning tickets per phase

### Phase Breakdown
Each competition is divided into 3 phases, each representing 1/3 of the total tickets:

- **Phase 1**: Tickets 1 to `competition_total_tickets * 1/3`
- **Phase 2**: Tickets `competition_total_tickets * 1/3 + 1` to `competition_total_tickets * 2/3`
- **Phase 3**: Tickets `competition_total_tickets * 2/3 + 1` to `competition_total_tickets`

## Prize Distribution Logic

### Phase Total Calculation
For each phase, the total winning tickets is calculated as:
```
phase_total_winning_tickets = sum(prize1_winning_ticket_qty, prize2_winning_ticket_qty, prize3_winning_ticket_qty, ...)
```

### Winning Ticket Number Generation

#### Phase 1
- **Range**: 1 to `competition_total_tickets * 1/3`
- **Example**: For 1000 total tickets â†’ Range: 1-333

#### Phase 2  
- **Range**: `competition_total_tickets * 1/3 + 1` to `competition_total_tickets * 2/3`
- **Example**: For 1000 total tickets â†’ Range: 334-666

#### Phase 3
- **Range**: `competition_total_tickets * 2/3 + 1` to `competition_total_tickets`
- **Example**: For 1000 total tickets â†’ Range: 667-1000

## Example Implementation

### Sample Competition
- **Total Tickets**: 1000
- **Phases**: 3
- **Prizes per Phase**:
  - Prize 1: 5 winning tickets
  - Prize 2: 3 winning tickets
  - Prize 3: 2 winning tickets
  - **Total per Phase**: 10 winning tickets

### Generated Winning Ticket Numbers

#### Phase 1 (Tickets 1-333)
- **Prize 1**: [45, 127, 89, 234, 156]
- **Prize 2**: [78, 201, 312]
- **Prize 3**: [167, 298]

#### Phase 2 (Tickets 334-666)
- **Prize 1**: [456, 389, 523, 445, 612]
- **Prize 2**: [478, 567, 401]
- **Prize 3**: [512, 634]

#### Phase 3 (Tickets 667-1000)
- **Prize 1**: [789, 723, 856, 912, 678]
- **Prize 2**: [745, 823, 901]
- **Prize 3**: [767, 889]

## Implementation Rules

### Constraints
1. **No Duplicates**: Each ticket number can only be used once per phase
2. **Range Validation**: All generated numbers must fall within the phase's ticket range
3. **Sum Validation**: Total winning tickets across all prizes must equal `phase_total_winning_tickets`
4. **Random Distribution**: Ticket numbers are randomly generated within each phase's range

### Database Considerations
- Store winning ticket numbers as arrays or JSON for each prize
- Maintain phase boundaries for validation
- Track which tickets have been assigned to prevent duplicates
- Consider indexing for efficient ticket number lookups

### Validation Logic
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for validation
function validatePhaseTickets(phase: number, totalTickets: number, winningTickets: number[]) {
  const phaseStart = Math.floor((phase - 1) * totalTickets / 3) + 1
  const phaseEnd = Math.floor(phase * totalTickets / 3)
  
  return winningTickets.every(ticket => 
    ticket >= phaseStart && ticket <= phaseEnd
  )
}
```

## Implementation Status

### ðŸ”§ Technical Details

#### Phase Boundary Calculation
```typescript
const phase1End = Math.floor(totalTickets / 3);
const phase2Start = phase1End + 1;
const phase2End = Math.floor((totalTickets * 2) / 3);
const phase3Start = phase2End + 1;
const phase3End = totalTickets;
```

#### Winning Ticket Generation
```typescript
// Generate unique winning ticket numbers within the phase range
while (winningTicketNumbers.length < ticketsToGenerate) {
  const ticketNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * (phaseEnd - phaseStart + 1)) + phaseStart;
  
  if (!usedTicketNumbers.has(ticketNumber)) {
    usedTicketNumbers.add(ticketNumber);
    winningTicketNumbers.push(ticketNumber);
  }
}
```

#### Validation Checks
1. **Phase Range Validation**: Ensures tickets are within phase boundaries
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: No duplicate tickets within a phase
3. **Quantity Validation**: Phase winning tickets don't exceed available tickets
4. **Total Range Validation**: All tickets within overall competition range
