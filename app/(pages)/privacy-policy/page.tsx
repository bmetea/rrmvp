            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>
                <strong>Request access to your personal data</strong> (commonly
                known as a &quot;data subject access request&quot;). This
                enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about
                you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  Request correction of the personal data that we hold about
                  you.
                </strong>{" "}
                This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we
                hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the
                accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Request erasure of your personal data.</strong> This
                enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where
                there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You
                also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
                data where you have successfully exercised your right to object
                to processing (see below), where we may have processed your
                information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
                personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we
                may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure
                for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if
                applicable, at the time of your request.
              </li>
              <li>

                  Object to processing of your personal data where we are

                (or those of a third party) and there is something about your
                particular situation which makes you want to object to
                processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
                fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to
                object where we are processing your personal data for direct
                marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we
                have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information
                which override your rights and freedoms.

                    legal claims.

                We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your
                personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
                format. Note that this right only applies to automated
                information which you initially provided consent for us to use
