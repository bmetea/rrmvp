            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>
                The Promoter may use different methods of choosing the winner,

                <ol
                  className="list-decimal pl-6 mt-2"
                  style={{ listStyleType: "lower-alpha" }}
                >
                  <li>
                    Main draw: All Entrants who correctly answer the Competition
                    Question will be placed into a draw and the winner will be
                    chosen by random draw. If no Competition Question is asked,
                    all Entrants will be entered into the random draw. The
                    random draw will take place as soon as reasonably possible
                    and, in any event, within 14 days of the Closing Date
                    (&quot;Draw Date&quot;);

                  <li>
                    Instant wins: All Entrants meeting the entry requirements
                    will be randomly allocated an entry number on completion and
                    payment of their entry. The Promoter will use a random
                    number generator to select an entry number for any Entrants
                    entering via the free entry route and meeting the entry
                    requirements. If the entry number corresponds with the
                    instant win number stated on the Website, the Entrant will
                    win that prize;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Auto draws: The Promoter may use an auto draw system for
                    choosing the winner or winners of the Main draw and any
                    Instant wins. For the Main draw, the system will be set to
                    randomly select a winner from all valid entries as soon as
                    the Closing Date is reached or all entries have been sold
                    (including allocation of free entries), whichever is sooner.
                    For Instant wins, the auto draw system will automatically
                    allocate the relevant prize to a winner if their entry
                    number matches the instant win number.

              </li>
              <li>
                All Entrants will have their names and entry numbers include on
                a spreadsheet which may be published on the Website and may be
                visible during the live draw. Names may also be posted on the
                website to indicate that an instant win prize has been won. If
                you do not wish to have your name included on this spreadsheet

                    The winner of the Prize will be required to enter into a
                    legally binding contract with either the Promoter or
                    Supplier in order to transfer the legal title of the Prize
