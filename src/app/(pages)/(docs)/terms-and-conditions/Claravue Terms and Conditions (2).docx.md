   1. The Promoter may use different methods of choosing the winner, depending on the format of the competition:

      1) Main draw: All Entrants who correctly answer the Competition Question will be placed into a draw and the winner will be chosen by random draw. If no Competition Question is asked, all Entrants will be entered into the random draw. The random draw will take place as soon as reasonably possible and, in any event, within 14 days of the Closing Date ("**Draw Date**");

      2) Instant wins: All Entrants meeting the entry requirements will be randomly allocated an entry number on completion and payment of their entry. The Promoter will use a random number generator to select an entry number for any Entrants entering via the free entry route and meeting the entry requirements. If the entry number corresponds with the instant win number stated on the Website, the Entrant will win that prize;

      3) Auto draws: The Promoter may use an auto draw system for choosing the winner or winners of the Main draw and any Instant wins. For the Main draw, the system will be set to randomly select a winner from all valid entries as soon as the Closing Date is reached or all entries have been sold (including allocation of free entries), whichever is sooner. For Instant wins, the auto draw system will automatically allocate the relevant prize to a winner if their entry number matches the instant win number. 

   2. All Entrants will have their names and entry numbers include on a spreadsheet which may be published on the Website and may be visible during the live draw. Names may also be posted on the website to indicate that an instant win prize has been won. If you do not wish to have your name included on this spreadsheet or posted on the website you must contact the Promoter via email at [*hello@radiancerewards.co.uk*](mailto:hello@radiancerewards.co.uk) as soon as reasonably possible after you have completed your entry and in any event, at least 48 hours before the live draw takes place.
