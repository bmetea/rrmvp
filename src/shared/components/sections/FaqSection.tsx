    question: "What happens if I get the question wrong?",
    answer:
      "Whilst this may be disappointing, you have to remember that this is a competition and we have deliberately made the question tough to comply with the law.

    question: "How is the winner decided?",
    answer:
      "Everyone who gets the answer to the question correct will be entered into a draw. The winner will then be chosen at random from all the correct entries.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are my chances of winning?",
    answer:
      'The maximum number of entries is stated on each competition so your chances of winning will vary from competition to competition. As an example, if entries are capped at a maximum of 3000, this means that if you purchase 1 entry and get the answer correct, your chances of winning will be no worse than 1 in 3,000.\n\nYou can increase your chances of winning by purchasing more entries. For example, if you purchase 10 entries in the example above and you get the answer correct, your chances of winning will be no worse than 1 in 300.\n\nWe say "no worse than" because we expect a significant number of people to get the answer to the question wrong. We cannot predict how many this will be but say 500 people got the answer wrong and they each purchased 1 entry each. Your chances of winning with a single correct entry will now improve to 1 in 2,500.',
  },
  {
    question: "Why is the question so hard?",
    answer:
      "This is not a lottery or a free prize draw. It is a prize competition and the law says that to be in with a chance of winning, you must demonstrate your skill, knowledge or judgement.\n\nThe law says that the question should be sufficiently difficult that a significant number of people either get the answer wrong or are put off entering. However, this means that the odds of winning are actually increased for those who get the answer correct.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "I haven't received an email confirming whether I am right or wrong.",
    answer:
      "If you haven't received an email from us confirming your entry and whether you got the question right or wrong, please check your spam folder. If it is not in there, please email us at hello@radiancerewards.co.uk",
